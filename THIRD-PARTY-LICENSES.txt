# Third-Party Software Licenses

This project includes software components from other projects with their own licenses:

## 7-Zip

**Component**: 7-Zip executable (7zz)
**Version**: 25.01
**Copyright**: © 1999-2025 Igor Pavlov
**License**: LGPL 2.1+ with unRAR restriction
**Website**: https://www.7-zip.org/
**Source Code**: https://www.7-zip.org/

### License Summary
7-Zip is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later, with an exception for the unRAR code. This license allows the 7-Zip binary to be bundled with applications under different licenses.

### LGPL 2.1+ License Text
The full license text is available at:
- https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html
- https://www.7-zip.org/license.txt

### Technical Implementation
This application does NOT modify, link to, or incorporate 7-Zip source code. Instead, it:
- Bundles the unmodified 7-Zip executable for user convenience
- Communicates with 7-Zip via subprocess calls and command-line interface
- Maintains complete process separation between application code and 7-Zip
- Functions as a CLI wrapper that calls 7-Zip as an external tool

This approach is similar to how Git GUI clients bundle the Git executable, or how video editors bundle FFmpeg - the LGPL component remains separate and unmodified.
